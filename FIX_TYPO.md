# A file with a opyT!

To practice using GitHub to contribute to one of our Call for Code open source projects, you can edit this file to fix the typo in the heading and create a pull request.

If you successfully fixed the typo, the workflow will tag the pull request as `status: approved`, then it close the pull request so that others can test making fixes as well. Congratulations, you've made your first pull request!

If not, the workflow will tag the pull request as `status: needs correction` and ask you to add another commit or submit another pull request to fix the typo.
